# [2.0.0](https://github.com/fluster/web-photo-filter/compare/v1.1.1...v2.0.0) (2018-08-12)

## Features

* **breaking changes**: Update the component in order to be compatible with **Ionic v4** and **Angular v6**

### Important note

I did not gave a try but this version might no be suitable anymore for Ionic v3 and Angular v5. If you are using the web-photo-filter component in such apps, you might better not upgrade and stick to the component version v1.1.1
